# About

A Snyk Netlify build plugin to add to your Netlify website's pipeline and guard you from deploying static websites with known JavaScript vulnerabilities.

# Usage

How to add security controls to your website build pipeline in 3 easy steps?

1. **Add the plugin!**

   If you're using Netlify's UI, browse the _Plugins_ directory and add `netlify-plugin-snyk` to your website project. Or you can also declare the plugin via a `netlify.yoml` configuration file as follows:

   ```
   # netlify.toml
   [[plugins]]
   package = "netlify-plugin-snyk"
   ```

2) **Configure the Snyk API token**

   If you alreay have the Snyk CLI installed you can get the token via `snyk config get api` and add an entry in Netlify's [Environment variable settings page](https://app.netlify.com/sites/speak-easy/settings/deploys#environment) with variable name `SNYK_TOKEN`.

   Note: For CI integrations and alike, we recommend creating a [Service account](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360004037597-Service-accounts) (available on the [pro plan](https://app.snyk.io/org/lirantal/manage/billing)) at an org-level to avoid coupling the Snyk token to a personal user account.

To obtain a Snyk API token go to `https://app.snyk.io/account`.

3. **Deploy safely** üê∂

# How it works?

- The Snyk security test runs on the `onPreBuild` event which means it gets triggered first, before a build has even started so it can fail fast and quick if any issues are found and you can attend to fixin them first.
- The security scan will automatically detect the package manager used in the project and will only scan production dependencies to reduce signal-to-noise ratio.
